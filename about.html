                    <h3>Eric Petit</h3>
                    <p class="bio-text">PhD, co-founded Project.Y, drawing on his deep expertise in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). With a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Rennes, earned at INRIA, Eric drives many AI/ML innovations for developer tools—including code generation and optimization—at Intel Corporation. His strong university collaborations fuel his passion for groundbreaking research. A committed open-source advocate, Eric’s work on projects like Verificarlo and MLKAPS highlights his dedication to accessible, community-driven technology. Alongside his co-founder, Eric launched Project.Y, where a flagship thesis explores common representations in agentic systems, laying the groundwork to tackle complex problems like those found in software engineering. Eric also co-organize our seminars with Adel, Hye-Young and Gregoire.</p>
