                    <p class="abstract-title">Abstract</p>
                    <p>In modern philosophy and modernity more broadly, notions such as self and consciousness are almost always conceived through the lens of subjectivity—whether explicitly or not. We think and live within the paradigm of the self as a subjective ego, yet this is a historically constructed idea. At the heart of contemporary consciousness studies lies the need to question this paradigm. This lecture explores what it means to be a subject, how the idea of subjectivity has been shaped in philosophical thought, and how it intersects with issues of reflection, embodiment, temporality, and our relation to others.</p>

                    <p class="abstract-title">Abstract</p>
                    <p>In this seminar, I would like to discuss Temporality in Heidegger's Being and Time. Heidegger's most famous work, Being and Time, as the title suggests, is an analysis of "being" and "time." However, it is important to note that this work does not deal with "being" in general or "time" as we conventionally understand it.
                    <br><br>
                    Another name for Being and Time is An Analysis of Dasein. In other words, this book is an
                    analysis of the being and time of Dasein. Therefore, to understand this analysis, we first need to
                    understand what Dasein is.
                    <br><br>
                    This lecture begins with a brief explanation of Dasein as a being. As we analyze the structure of
                    Dasein's being, we will encounter and address the following concepts that Heidegger presents:
                    world, temporality, death, anxiety, care, guilt, freedom, and understanding.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, I will explain how my interpretation of emergence (Geschehen), history (Geschichte), 
                    or story (Geschichte) integrates into these concepts and discuss their significance.
                    </p>
