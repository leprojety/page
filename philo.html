            <h2>Symbolon Seminar</h2>
            <p>The word symbolon originates from ancient Greek, derived from symballein, meaning "to throw together" or "to join." A symbolon was a physical token, often a clay or bone object, broken into two pieces, each held by different parties. When reunited, the pieces confirmed their connection, revealing a complete meaning or identity. This seminar embodies that concept, acting as a symbolon to bridge fragmented knowledge, uniting diverse perspectives with art as a subtle, connective medium to deepen our understanding of the AI era and its profound impact on human existence.</p><br>

                    <p class="abstract-title">Abstract</p>
                    <p>This talk is a conversation about the geometrical and topological structure of conversation. We will show how the very act of sharing consciousness and language leads to the structure of the Complex numbers and the context of the complex plane - the conversants imaged at the distinct places Of +1 and -1 on the unit circle. The I and - I (square roots of negative unity) take the role of the Linguistic "I" associated with the conversant (I for +1 and -I for -1). The shift across the top of the unit circle for I corresponds to that place where +1 hands the speech over to -1 and the shift across the bottom of the unit circle for -I corresponds to that place where -1 hands the speech over to +1. We will discuss the role of Euler's formula and how an oscillatory view of the square root of negative unity is related to the Eulerian universal cover of the circle by the real line. This point of view leads to a wider language of categories for conversational domains. We shall see that an embedding of the complex plane into the projective plane yields insight into the nature of the roots of meaningful exchange. At the introduction of the projective plane, we find the concept of the observer and the relative nature of the bifurcation of the real and the imaginary that gives rise to the distinction of conversation.</p>

                    <p class="abstract-title">Abstract</p>
                    <p>20th century phenomenology arose as a response to developments in science and mathematics in the late 19th century. Physics is supposed to tell us what is real, but the physicists' idea of reality seemed to retreat farther and farther from our everyday experience. It seemed that what is experienced is not real and what is real is not experienced. To do justice to our experience, phenomenologists neither deny science nor try to explain experience in its terms. Instead they "bracket" science and subject experience to a rigorous description in its own terms.</p>

                    <p class="abstract-title">Abstract</p>
                    <p>In modern philosophy and modernity more broadly, notions such as self and consciousness are almost always conceived through the lens of subjectivity—whether explicitly or not. We think and live within the paradigm of the self as a subjective ego, yet this is a historically constructed idea. At the heart of contemporary consciousness studies lies the need to question this paradigm. This lecture explores what it means to be a subject, how the idea of subjectivity has been shaped in philosophical thought, and how it intersects with issues of reflection, embodiment, temporality, and our relation to others.</p>

                    <p class="abstract-title">Abstract</p>
                    <p>In this seminar, I would like to discuss Temporality in Heidegger's Being and Time. Heidegger's most famous work, Being and Time, as the title suggests, is an analysis of "being" and "time." However, it is important to note that this work does not deal with "being" in general or "time" as we conventionally understand it.
                    <br><br>
                    Another name for Being and Time is An Analysis of Dasein. In other words, this book is an
                    analysis of the being and time of Dasein. Therefore, to understand this analysis, we first need to
                    understand what Dasein is.
                    <br><br>
                    This lecture begins with a brief explanation of Dasein as a being. As we analyze the structure of
                    Dasein's being, we will encounter and address the following concepts that Heidegger presents:
                    world, temporality, death, anxiety, care, guilt, freedom, and understanding.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, I will explain how my interpretation of emergence (Geschehen), history (Geschichte), 
                    or story (Geschichte) integrates into these concepts and discuss their significance.
                    </p>
