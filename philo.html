            <h2>Symbolon</h2>
            Symbolon is a broken token in ancient Greece that only reveals its full meaning when reassembledâ€”just as this seminar seeks to bridge fragmented knowledge, bringing together diverse perspectives to deepen our understanding of the AI era and its profound impact on human existence.

                In this seminar, I would like to discuss Temporality in Heidegger's Being and Time. Heidegger's most famous work, Being and Time, as the title suggests, is an analysis of "being" and "time." However, it is important to note that this work does not deal with "being" in general or "time" as we conventionally understand it.
                <br><br>
                Another name for Being and Time is An Analysis of Dasein. In other words, this book is an
                analysis of the being and time of Dasein. Therefore, to understand this analysis, we first need to
                understand what Dasein is.
                <br><br>
                This lecture begins with a brief explanation of Dasein as a being. As we analyze the structure of
                Dasein's being, we will encounter and address the following concepts that Heidegger presents:
                world, temporality, death, anxiety, care, guilt, freedom, and understanding.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, I will explain how my interpretation of emergence (Geschehen), history (Geschichte), 
                or story (Geschichte) integrates into these concepts and discuss their significance.
